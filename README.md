## Contribution
We worked equally during the course of the assignment, so we have an equal contribution to its completion.

## MultiThreader
Our MultiThreader implementation can efficiently parallelize both 1D and 2D loops using multiple threads.

### How It Works:
- **1D Loops**: Directly parallelized using multiple threads.
- **2D Loops**: Flattened into a 1D loop and then broken into smaller chunks for parallelization.
